            termination of your account on our Service.<br />

            You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to
            access the Service and for any activities or actions under your

            including without limitation if you breach the Terms.<br />

            laws of Germany, without regard to its conflict of law
            provisions.<br />

            Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will
            not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of
            these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the
            remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. These
            Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our

            We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace
            these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to
            provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking
            effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our
            sole discretion.<br />

            By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions
            become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you
            do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service.<br /><br />
