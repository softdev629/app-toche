                    <p>A match is divided into five sets and these in turn are divided into five songs, so there are 25 songs in total. </p><br>
                    <p>You compete with your opponent to see who makes more points during a song, which is 2 minutes long. So the actual playing time is 50 minutes of non-stop action.</p><br>
                    <p>There are 1-minute breaks in between the sets. During the songs, the action is nonstop and only a serious injury can stop the match. You can’t drink or tie your shoelaces during a song.</p><br>
                    <p>A song is literally a song. The idea is that you play with your favourite music, just make sure it’s not going to put you to sleep. Toche is a high-adrenaline sport, so make a playlist that matches it.</p><br>

                    <p>The winner of the match is whoever wins more songs—there are 25 songs in a match, so there’s always going to be a winner. At the end of the match, add all the lines (songs won) in the Set Box column each players has, and input it in the Songs cell (arrow #3).</p><br>

                    <p>If you and your opponent are tied at the end of a song, just write the points (same amount for both players) and put an “X” in the middle column. At the end of the match, you throw a round of penalties. If you continue to be tied, throw more rounds until there is a winner. This is called a tie-break. </p><br>
                    <p>The winner of the tie-break gets only one more point on that song, even if you threw many penalties which added to a larger amount of points.</p>nr
                    <p>During these extra rounds, players still have to run and all other rules apply. For example, in a song tie-break, you can still be penalised for not running.</p>

                    <p>Anyone can open an arena and all you have to do is register on the Toche League website. It is free of charge and it enables your players to compete for the annual Toche Championship. Arenas also get all the support and materials you need, as well as invitations to participate in city-level tournaments. </p><br>

                    <h2 class="book-section">CUPS</h2>
                    <p>Sports are part of our culture, and each sport has its own idiosyncrasy and traditions. An important pillar of Toche is competitiveness. </p><br>
                    <p>The objective of the Toche League is to make sure that every single match you play is part of a tournament. Not playing a friendly match with your buddy but a tournament match motivates players to give all they’ve got in each match.</p><br>
                    <h3>A UNIFIED SPORT</h3>
                    <p>Toche does not make any gender distinctions, both females and males play in the same league. The sport was developed with this in mind. The weight of the balls, the platform-target distance, and the layout of the loop all render a level playing field. Toche is ultimately about stamina and concentration. </p><br>
                    <h3>TOURNAMENT STARS</h3>
                    <p>A tournament can be a 5-match competition you launch with a friend, a city-wide, country-wide or global tournament. They are all considered tournaments and they award stars (tournament points) towards the annual Toche Championship, which selects the best player in the world. Whenever you take part in a tournament, you will earn a number of stars—even if you end up last.</p><br>
                    <ul>The number of stars you get depends on:
                        <li class="book-bullet">Your position on the standings table, the first place gets obviously more stars.</li>
                        <li class="book-bullet">The level of the tournament (eg. global vs neighbourhood). Higher-level tournaments give out more stars. </li>
                        <li class="book-bullet">The size of the tournament, that is, how many players participated in the tournament. The size of the tournament, that is, how many players participated in the tournament. A city level tournament with 64 participants awards more stars than one with only 16.
                        </li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <h3>TOURNAMENT STATISTICS</h3>
                    <p>Having matches be part of a tournament enables you to keep track of your performance statistics, such as highest points in a match or song, average points per song or efficiency percentage.</p><br>
                    <p>Toche League keeps track of all the tournaments and the player statistics.</p><br>
                    <p>Stars awarded comparison between arena and city level tournaments. It also depends on the number of players.</p><br>

                    <h2 class="book-section">RANKING PARAMETERS</h2>
                    <p>Efficiency Percentage, usually appearing as Efficiency % or E%, is the percentage of points you make in relation to the maximum potential points in a match—approx. 1020 per match or 68 per song. In other words, if every time you threw you would score 2 points, you would make around 1020 points in the match. Your E% is the percentage of that number that you actually made.</p><br>
                    <p>Efficiency % can be used to compare the level of the players. Besides showing off, this is useful in league organisation to break the players into different divisions—first division, second division, etc.—and to calculate the ranking in the World Toche League.</p><br>
                    <p>E% also helps you keep track of your progress when you start playing Toche. It motivates you to see how you start to improving your Efficiency.</p>
