                <p>The main areas of the court are: platform, runway, target, barrier and cheering area.</p><br>
                <img src="/pix/court-grass.webp" alt="" class="book-chap-overview"><br><br><br>
                <p>This little poem explains it better:</p><br>
                <div class="book-quote">
                    <P>Throw your balls from the platform,<br>
                        Run like hell along the runway,<br>
                        Pick up your balls in the target,<br>
                        Cover your ass behind the barrier,<br>
                        Run, baby, run before the third ball is thrown,<br>
                        Annoy your opponent in the cheering area,<br>
                        Run like hell once again,<br>
                        And when you get back to the platform,<br>
                        Burn thy friend who dares not run,<br>
                        Or aim for the target if your friend was swift.</P><BR>
                </div>

                <P>You can play indoors on sand, wooden floors or hard surfaces; and outdoors on sand, grass, gravel or hard surfaces. <strong>Playing on sand is ideal. </strong>When setting up a court, make sure you’re not going to play facing the sun—it would blind you when throwing the balls.</P><BR></BR>

                <h3>DISTANCE TO TARGET</h3>
                <p>The platform is 8 metres from the target, but can be placed as close as 2 metres for the mini ones. As they grow and progress, they throw from farther away, incrementing the distance by 0.5 m until they get to 8 m.  Grown ups and kids can play together, they just throw from different distances.</p><br>
                <p>Four-year old throwing from 4 m. At this early age, kids need help with counting and they may not be able to concentrate over a full match. They can start playing just 1 or 2 sets.</p><br>
                <p>Throwing from different distances is the way for children and beginners to start playing.</p>

            <section class="scroll-item" id="rb-target">
                <h2 class="book-section">TARGET</h2>

                <p>The target consists of the basket, the pole and the base. If playing without a wall, you can use a sandbag to stop it from sliding. It can be made of plastic, wood or metals. The pole is attached to a base or it can be buried in the sand—in that case, draw the base in the sand. </p><br>
                <p>Diameter:  21 cm<br>
                    Basket Depth:  15-25 cm<br>
                    Pole length:  80 cm (base to rim)<br>
                    Pole Inclination:  57% degrees<br>
                    Base Dimensions:  40 cm x 50 cm </p>

            <section class="scroll-item" id="rb-wall">
                <h2 class="book-section">WALL</h2>

                <p>Toche can be played with or without a wall behind the target. It requires more brain processing power to play without a wall, as it is more difficult for the eye to calculate the distance. The downside is that you have to run bit more to pick up the balls, but the speed is about the same. Playing without a wall is preferred.</p><br>
                <p>However, in some cases, the use of a wall may be imposed or convenient. For example, if you are playing inside a sport hall or a squash court, playing with a wall might be unavoidable. If you are playing outdoors it may be inconvenient to play without a wall because the balls could go over a fence, on the street or a body of water. If not having a wall is going to interrupt the match, then you should use one. </p><br>
                <p>From left to right: Prototype of a target with a wall (dimensions: 200 cm wide x 170 cm tall); small wall improvised with a Toche equipment bag. Gravel court without a wall. Gravel court with a wall.</p>

                <h2 class="book-section">SCORESHEET</h2>

                <p>In order to keep the score during the match, print a scoresheet template and write the points after each song. After the match, you can input it to a tournament digital template. These templates keep track of the standings in a tournament, and show your performance statistics.</p><br>
                <p>To keep track of the match duration, download the Toche Match Timing audio file. It has whistle sounds to mark the 2-minute songs as well as the breaks. Play the file on your mobile phone, and on your opponent’s phone play a playlist with your favourite music. </p><br>
                <p>A bluetooth speaker with proper volume is a must if you really wanna rock.</p>
