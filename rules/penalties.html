          Penalties are four extra throws granted to a player because the
          opponent broke a rule. When you get penalised, let your opponent throw
          the 4 balls of his/her round. Then, QUICKLY pick up his/her balls and
          bring them to him/her. Your opponent will get to throw 4 more balls
          (the penalties) and then the game proceeds as usual.

            Players must throw standing behind the platform line. Standing on
            the line is penalised—even if it’s just 1 cm. Clip your toenails if
            you must, but stay behind the line.

          <p>
            When throwing the balls, you can’t swing your arms to calibrate how
            you throw. You can only make one movement forward. You can start the
            motion by stretching your arm forward, then pull back and swing
            forward in one single motion.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Sample video: One swing only, please, but swinging outside of the
            court is perfectly fine...

            If you arrive to the cheering area after your opponent has thrown
            the first ball with her left hand, you will be penalised. She will
            finish throwing the last ball with the left hand, then you will run
            to pick up the four balls and deliver them to her with a humble
            smile.

          <p>
            The girl is too late. She now has to wait for the woman to throw the
            fourth ball. Then, the girl must pick up the balls for her and
            deliver them to the woman, who throws four balls again. After that,
            it’s the girl’s turn.

          <br />
          <p>
            Throw your four balls and pick them up as usual. When your opponent
            finishes throwing the next round, pick up the balls for her and
            deliver them. She will throw four balls again. Slapping yourself for
            such a stupid mistake is an option.

            You are allowed to cheer for yourself and annoy the hell out of your
            opponent. However, you will be penalised if you:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li class="book-bullet">

          <br />
          <p>
            Albeit not being gracious, farting is not considered hooligan
            behaviour, and so, it’s not penalised... It won’t make you many
            friends, but it can give you an edge—specially if you’re playing
            indoors.

            Your opponent will continue throwing, running, picking up, running

            running or makes a mistake in the count, the score will be frozen at
            that point. Both can rest until the next song begins.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            If you stop doing the loser sign, your opponent can hit you with the

          <h2 class="book-section">TURTLE DELIVERY</h2>
          <p>
            Whenever you get penalised or get burned you have to pick up your
            opponents balls and deliver them quickly. If you take your time to
            pick them up or drag your feet to deliver them, it is another
            penalty.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Being penalised sucks, but incurring in a double penalty is the
            worst thing that can happen to you. Your opponent will get to throw
            2 extra rounds, and catch her breath, while you will be running and
            delivering the balls like a fool.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            So, whenever you get penalised, do yourself a favour and be quick
            about it.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            After you pick up the balls for your opponent, you have to run and
            put them in her hands gently.
          </p>
          <br />

          <ul class="go-top">

        <section id="rb-forget-penalty">
          <h2 class="book-section">FORGET PENALTIES</h2>
          <p>
            If you get penalised and forget about it, say you run to the
            cheering area instead of waiting by the barrier, you will be
            penalised.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Once again, this is something worth slapping yourself about. It is
            practically giving away the song to your opponent.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            So, whenever you get penalised, go and stand by the barrier. Since
            carrying 8 balls may be difficult, you can throw yours to the
            cheering area and get ready to pick your opponents balls quickly.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            ABOVE: the player forgot she had incurred in a penalty and had to go
            pick up the balls.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            BELOW: when you get penalised, wait in the corner after the
            barrier—not too close that you interfere with the player throwing.
            You can only annoy your opponent when you are in the cheering area.
