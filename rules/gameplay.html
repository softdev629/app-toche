          Toche is a 1-on-1 sport. <br /><br />
          It consists of throwing four balls at a target to get points.
          <br /><br />You and your opponent take turns to throw the balls, and
          you have to run like crazy the whole match! <br /><br />
          It's pretty simple, really. You don’t need to be a genius to play
          Toche, but you'll become one.

          <p>
            In each round, you first throw two balls with your right hand, and
            then two with your left. Keeping this order is mandatory, you will
            get penalised otherwise. You can only hold one ball with the hand
            you’re throwing.

            You throw the balls from the platform to the target and add the
            points that you make every time you throw. If the ball goes inside
            the target, you get 2 points. If the ball touches the rim, and
            bounces outside the target base, you get 1 point. If the ball
            touches the rim, bounces on the base, and lands outside the base,
            you get 1 point. If the ball miraculously lands on the rim and stays
            there, you get 1 point—even if the next ball hits the target and
            makes it fall inside. If the ball touches the rim, and directly
            lands inside the base, you get nothing. If the ball touches the rim,
            bounces on the base, and lands inside the base, you get nothing.

          <h2 class="book-section">COUNTING</h2>
          <p>
            After throwing each ball, you must add (in your mind) the points you
            just made to the points you had, and then say out loud the new total
            amount. This procedure enhances your concentration power and reduces
            the risk of misunderstandings and cheating. The two players get to
            decide on the language they want to count in, which should be the
            same for both players. English should be the common ground for all
            players in case they speak different native languages.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In this sample video, the player had 8 points before she starts her
            turn and throws the four balls.

          <h2 class="book-section">TAKING TURNS</h2>
          <p>
            In Toche, players take turns to throw, run, pick up, run, cheer and
            run. That is all you’re going to be doing for an hour, but, oh boy,
            if it’s fun! And tiring. Running means running, not jogging or
            walking like you’re holding a number two. Not running is a major
            violation of the game and is punished with pain and penalties. More
            on this in a bit. If you leave a ball behind, you must run and throw
            only three balls in your next turn. If your opponent touches your
            ball, he will be penalised. You can’t throw before you get to the
            platform. Once you arrive at the platform, you can throw. You don’t
            need to wait for your friend to move out. More on this exquisite
            aspect of the game in the burning section.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throw your balls: two with the right, then two with the left. And
            don't forget to count.
          </p>
          <p>Run to the target.</p>
          <p>
            Pick up your balls and be quick about it because your ass is
            exposed!
          </p>
          <p>Run to the cheering area to be annoying.</p>
          <p>
            Cheer for yourself if you get approval from your lungs. Otherwise,
            just breathe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Run back to the platform. if you are lucky, you can burn your
            friend.

        <section id="rb-burning">
          <h2 class="book-section">BURNING</h2>

          <p>
            If you arrive to the target and your opponent is still picking her
            balls, you can throw and burn her. Burning gives you 2 points! Once
            you burn her once, stop throwing and enjoy the view: your opponent
            has to pick up your balls and bring them to you. You will throw
            again your four balls.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Burning gives you the opportunity to make 10 points in one turn!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            When delivering the balls, your opponent must run—or it will be
            another penalty. She must put the balls on your hands, gently.
            Smiling at this point would rub it in, so it’s highly recommended.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>BURNING PROTECTION.</h3>
          <p>
            You can’t burn your opponent if she is standing to the left of the
            barrier. Even if you are just using a cone, the position of the
            opponent relevant to the cone is enough to decide if she’s standing
            behind the barrier or not. If it’s a close call, then it won’t count
            as a penalty. On the bright side, you still got to burn her!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            When you are picking up the balls, you can of course try to dodge
            the ball. However, make sure you still run because if you stay near
            the target too long, you could arrive late to the Cheering Area and
            still be penalised (more on that on the Penalties Section)
          </p>

          <ul class="go-top">

        <section id="rb-cheering">
          <h2 class="book-section">CHEERING</h2>
          <p>
            In Toche you are allowed to cheer for yourself, sing, dance, do the
            wave, joke and, in general, do anything that can distract your
            opponent. However, don’t step out of the Cheering Area.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Rationale: Since Toche is also a sport of the mind, cheering is
            allowed because it makes you concentrate on your turn disregarding
            of the external stimuli produced by an obnoxious opponent.
            Professional football players need to deal with the pressure from
            100,000 screaming spectators. In Toche, the pressure comes from your
            opponent trying to make you lose your concentration.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Warning: The downside of cheering is that it will make you lose your
            own concentration and, most important, it drains your energy. Use it
            wisely.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            “A master Toche player is a jackass when cheering, yet calm as a
            sunset when throwing.”
